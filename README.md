# NHL-Scores-Extraction
This notebook extracts data about NHL scores from espn.com.

This is a web scraper I built as practice. Feel free to use it for yourself if you're an avid NHL fan who wants to automate getting scores.

Note that if by some chance anyone else actually *wants* to use this, you'll need your own chromedriver as well as path specification. You can find downloads at https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads to match your version of Chrome. Other web drivers are also available for selenium as well.
