    "# More Web Scraping Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "I built this notebook for some more practice web scraping data. In this one, we are scraping the scores of NHL games from ESPN.com. I initially tried loading these scores from nhl.com, but I encountered some problems I did not know how to fix until later on in this project when I was doing more research into scraping. Thus, the data seen below is coming from a source I don't particularly use too often. Anyway, it was good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gist of the problem is that when requesting content from a URL, the requests module does not read dynamically changing elements from webpages. It was frustrating to see that I could not scrape a simple time, i.e. 6:00 PM, from a 'div' element, when it clearly was there while I was inspecting the page in Chrome. The solution was using the selenium module to load an instance of a webpage which does capture dynamically changing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would obviously be more useful as a script you can rig to run every now and then.. but again, this was just for practice and was done in an afternoon."
